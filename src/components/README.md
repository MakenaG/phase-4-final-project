# Our Project
This phase, our group decided to work on a movie website. We had asimple concept, to create a page where users can watch movies or videos and be capable of interacting with them. 

We decided to name our site KenyaFlix (sounds like a bit of a knockoff) to credit our inspiration.

# KenyaFlix
KenyaFlix is a website with various features. These are:
  
  - Login/Logout functionality
  - Users can click on individual films to view them
  - Reviews can be added by users to movies
  - A NavBar that has routes to different pages
  - A signup feature to take in new users 

# Features
Our website shows movies to users and allows them to create accounts on this page. Once an account has been created the user has to login. On login the user is taken to their profile page where they have access to their favorite videos and can upload their own videos. The navbar at the top of the page allows users to logout, see videos and movies.

# Cloning the repo
To vlone the repo one should fork the repository and clone it into their local environment with the ['git clone']
command. Once that is done they should run ['npm install'] within the directory that has just been cloned to get in place the dependencies that the websit has.

# Deployment
Both our back-end and front-end have been fully deployed, the link for our front end page is within the about section of the repository
